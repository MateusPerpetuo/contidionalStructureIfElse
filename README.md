# contidionalStructureIfElse

Recently, as part of my Java studies, I worked on a programming exercise focused on conditional structures "If" and "Else".
With that in mind, in this exercise i develop a system that calculates the average grade of students.  

First, I created an array to store the individual grades of the students. Then, I used a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of all the grades.

After obtaining the total sum of the grades, I divided it by the number of subjects that the students has (4) to calculate the average.

Next, I utilized a conditional structure to check if the average was equal to or above a certain value, thus establishing a passing criteria. Depending on the result of this check, the system displayed a message indicating whether the student had passed or failed.
